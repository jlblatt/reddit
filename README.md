In early 2011, reddit.com hosted a programming and design contest in order to grow their team. This project was created to mirror live reddit data from their JSON API through a cleaner interface. It is mostly client-side Javascript with a few simple backend scripts to allow cookies to work. Users can view stories/subreddits/comments, search, sort, login and vote.
